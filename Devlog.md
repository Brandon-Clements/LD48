# Devlog

## Friday Night

Brainstormed [Ideas](Ideas.md)

Created Travis CI Pipeline that auto deploys to github pages.

Had hoped to have level 1 done before calling it a night, but pipeline took
longer than anticipated. Need to create template project before next compo.

Think I will go with raising seas platformer idea. The water gets deeper and
deeper, you must constantly climb the tower in order to stay alive.

Plan going forward,
Saturday: get game playable
Sunday: sound/art, Theme web version, Upload to Itch.IO, Build desktop versions
